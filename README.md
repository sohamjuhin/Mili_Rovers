# Mili_Rovers
rovers space
Python code that uses a Raspberry Pi 4 with 6 motors and a sonar sensor to control a rover. This code assumes that you have connected the motors and the sonar sensor to the appropriate GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.


This code defines functions for moving the rover forward (forward()), stopping the rover (stop()), and getting the distance from the sonar sensor (get_distance()). It uses the GPIO library to set up and control the GPIO pins for the motors and the sonar sensor.

The main loop continuously measures the distance using the sonar sensor and moves the rover forward if the distance is greater than 20 cm. If the distance is less than 20 cm, the rover stops.

Remember to install the required libraries (RPi.GPIO) before running the code. You can install it using the following command:



pip install RPi.GPIO




Please note that this is a basic example to get you started, and you may need to modify the code according to your specific hardware setup and requirements.
